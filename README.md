# SHINE APP  

### Description  
This app is an internal app for an organization which will help the employees,
who are in charge of customer service, to find information about their
customers and take appropriate action.

### Building Blocks   
This app will be built with Rails, Angular, Bootstrap & Postgres. The reasons
for choosing Angular & Bootstrap for the frontend is obvious. Postgres was
chosen over other sql databases as postgres provides many more functionalities
such as adding constraints at the database level to prevent bad data, Advanced
Indexing for search etc.

This app is an attempt to work on the complete stack of web-development. Using
a production quality database like Postgres, a frontend framework like Angular
and Boostrap for styling with the power of Rails for the backend, all aspects
of the app will be of production quality.   

## Heroku Link  
Work in progress. Will be deployed to Heroku soon.
